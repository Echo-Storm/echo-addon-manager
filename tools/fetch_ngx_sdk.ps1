# Fetches the NVIDIA DLSS SDK files the Neural Rendering addon needs from NVIDIA's own public repository, https://github.com/NVIDIA/DLSS, into
# addons\DLSS5NR01\external\ngx: the headers and static library to build it, NVIDIA's DLSS runtime (nvngx_dlss.dll, for the DLAA model), and
# NVIDIA's licence, which goes into the release next to them. Nothing is taken from anywhere else, and nothing is committed: that folder is
# ignored by git. NVIDIA's licence allows the runtime and the library's object code to ship inside an application such as this one, under
# its own terms (not this project's MIT licence); see NOTICE.md.
#
# The files are pinned to one commit of NVIDIA's repository and checked against SHA-256 values, so what you build against is what this
# addon was built against. Files already in place that match are left alone.
#
# NVIDIA's RTX SDKs licence applies to these files, and using them means accepting it:
#   https://github.com/NVIDIA/DLSS/blob/main/LICENSE.txt
# so the download only runs when you say you accept it:
#   powershell -File tools\fetch_ngx_sdk.ps1 -AcceptNvidiaLicense [-Dest <folder>]
#
# -Latest takes NVIDIA's newest commit instead of the pinned one (-Commit <sha> takes a commit you name). Those files are checked against
# NVIDIA's own git object ids rather than against the pinned SHA-256 values, and the script prints the lines to paste in here to pin them.
# The pinned commit is "DLSS 310.9.1 SDK", NVIDIA's newest at the time of writing.
