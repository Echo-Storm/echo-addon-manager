// D3D11Hook: finds Lossless Scaling's D3D11 device, and runs the addons' pre- and post-dispatch callbacks around each of its compute passes.
//
// The device: Lossless_original.dll calls D3D11CreateDevice through its delay-load table; that slot is pointed at ours, which hands every device it
// makes to the host (and publishes the device events).
//
// The passes: a code hook on each ID3D11DeviceContext::Dispatch implementation in d3d11.dll, which runs the callbacks only for the immediate
// contexts of those devices: all of them, since Lossless Scaling makes more than one and its compute passes run on the first. Not a patch of the
// context's function table: each context keeps its own copy of that table, and ID3D11Multithread::SetMultithreadProtected() (which Lossless
// Scaling calls) swaps the copy's entries, dropping a patched slot.
