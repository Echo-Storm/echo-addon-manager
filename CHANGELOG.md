# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Manager: addon handling, settings file, host interface, toggle switch, toast, addon card and logs tab rewritten** as smaller modules with the same behaviour
  (on the `rewrite` branch until it has run in Lossless Scaling). New offline test `lsproxy_coretest` covers scanning, manifests, loading, starting, switching,
  removing, installing, the security levels, a faulting addon, the settings file and the host interface (94 checks); the window pictures are pixel-identical
  before and after (`tools/compare_ui_renders.py`). Small fixes on the way: a wrong-typed field in `addon.json` is skipped instead of dropping the rest of the
  manifest, and loading a second settings file no longer inherits what the first one last saved. The share of the manager's code that is still the original
  project's went from 42.8% to 33.8% (`tools/measure_original_share.py`).
- **DLSS 5 Neural Rendering: Ghost guard.** New slider that fades the model's change where Lossless Scaling's motion data is unreliable and as the change ages, to remove the faint
  copy of the previous frame that could trail moving things. Default 0.5; 0 restores the old behaviour. See the addon's changelog.

## 0.1.0 (first release)

The first release of Echo Addon Manager as its own project, with a fresh history. It started from FrankBarretta's
[LosslessProxy](https://github.com/FrankBarretta/LosslessProxy) (see [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md)).

### Manager
- Loads in place of Lossless Scaling's `Lossless.dll`, forwards to the original, and loads addons from `addons\`.
- Window with tabs Addons, Performance, Settings, Logs and About, in a dark neutral and green look with vector icons, tooltips on every control,
  and an interface size setting (75% to 200%). Hides to the notification area; opens again from its icon or a hotkey (Ctrl+Shift+F12 by default).
- **Install addon** from a folder, zip or DLL (button or drag and drop; new addons arrive switched off) and **Remove** with confirmation (moved to
  `addons\.removed`, never erased). Addon search (Ctrl+F). Each addon's settings, overview and config file in a detail pane.
- **Performance tab**: game frame rate and frame time, addon cost, GPU load, power, clocks, temperature and memory (NVML, read only while the tab
  is open), 20-second graphs and a plain-words summary.
- **Live status and metrics**: `SetStatus` and `PublishMetric` on the addon interface; a status line on each card and in the status bar.
- **Backup and restore** of all settings; **diagnostics zip** with logs, settings and a summary (nothing uploaded).
- Settings that work and save at once: security level, log detail, auto-load, open at start, hotkey.
- Atomic settings writes, a corrupt settings file is kept rather than replaced, a bounded log with timestamps, crash backtraces for the manager
  and any addon, a faulting addon is isolated, and Dear ImGui is pinned so addons and the manager share one layout.
- Addon API **1.0.0**, separate from the release number (`sdk/include/lsproxy/version.h`).

### Addons
- **DLSS 5 Neural Rendering** (andreiday, extended): read-only tap of Lossless Scaling's frames, a free-running model, present-time compose.
  Saved looks in a bar at the top of the panel, per-program looks, rectangles that keep the HUD untouched, shadows and highlights, sharpen,
  saturation and vibrance, film grain, temporal smoothing, compare and hotkeys, a live status line. Its own history is in
  [its changelog](addons/LSP-NeuralRender/CHANGELOG.md).
- **ReShade Input Passthrough**: reworked as a plain switch with a tooltip; window handling restored cleanly and pinned when it cannot be undone. Offline lifecycle test.
- **Windowed Mode**: reworked as a plain switch, panel fixed; adds the virtual display only while enabled. Offline test.

### Tools and tests
- `tools\build_all.ps1`, `deploy.ps1` (backs up, refuses while Lossless Scaling or your game runs), `run_addon_tests.ps1`, `run_hosttest_matrix.py`
  (ten Neural Rendering scenarios), `ui_preview.ps1` (offscreen renders of every tab), `package.ps1` (the release zip).
